# 16: Code Samples Using the Prism Library 5.0 for WPF

From: [Developer's Guide to Microsoft Prism Library 5.0 for WPF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg406140.aspx)

The code samples for the Prism Library for WPF are focused applications that illustrate specific Prism-related concepts. The QuickStarts and Reference Implementation are an ideal starting point if you want to gain an understanding of a key concept such as Modularity, MVVM, Commands, UI Composition, Navigation, Event Aggregations, User Interactivity, and Composite Application. The Stock Trader Reference Implementation demonstrates proven practices for implementing composite applications. The samples include both source code and documentation.

In order to build and run the samples select the appropriate shortcut file and press F5 to build and run.

## Installing Prism

This section describes how to install Prism. It involves the following three steps:

1.  Install system requirements.
2.  Extract the Prism source code and documentation.
3.  Compile and run QuickStarts, Reference Implementation or Prism Library source code.

## Step 1: Install System Requirements

Prism was designed to run on the Microsoft Windows 8 desktop, Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008 operating system. WPF applications built using this guidance require the .NET Framework 4.5.

Before you can use the Prism Library, the following must be installed:

-   Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 (installed with Visual Studio 2012) or Microsoft .NET Framework 4.51.
-   Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Professional, Premium, or Ultimate editions or Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Professional, Premium, or Ultimate editions.

>**Note:** Visual Studio 2013 Express Edition can be used to develop Prism applications using the Prism Library.

Optionally, you should consider also installing the following:

-   [Microsoft Blend for Visual Studio 2013](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/blend_overview.aspx). A professional design tool for creating compelling user experiences and applications for WPF.

## Step 2: Extract the Prism Source Code, and Documentation

To install the Prism assets, right-click the downloaded file, and then click **Run as administrator**. This will extract the source code and documentation into the folder of your choice. You may also need to right-click the file and unblock before you can extract the contents.

## Step 3: Compile and run QuickStarts, Reference Implementation or Prism Library source code.

In order to build and run the code sample, select the appropriate shortcut file and press F5 to build and run.
