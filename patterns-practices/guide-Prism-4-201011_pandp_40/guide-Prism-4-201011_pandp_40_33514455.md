## Summary

Prism provides guidance designed to help you more easily design and build rich, flexible, and easily maintained Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop applications, Silverlight Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), and Windows Phone 7 applications. Using design patterns that embody important architectural design principles, such as separation of concerns and loose coupling, Prism helps you to design and build applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently but which can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application. These types of applications are known as composite applications.

## Intended Audience

Prism is intended for software developers building WPF or Silverlight applications that typically feature multiple screens, rich user interaction and data visualization, and that embody significant presentation and business logic. These applications typically interact with a number of back-end systems and services and, using a layered architecture, may be physically deployed across multiple tiers. It is expected that the application will evolve significantly over its lifetime in response to new requirements and business opportunities. In short, these applications are "built to last" and "built for change." If your application does not need to last or need to change, then you may not benefit from using Prism.

**Note:** Even single-person projects can realize the benefits by creating more testable and maintainable applications that can evolve over time using the modular approach.

## Architectural Goals

The guidance is designed to help architects and developers achieve the following objectives:

-   Create an application from modules that can be built, assembled and, optionally, deployed by independent teams using WPF or Silverlight.
-   Minimize cross-team dependencies and allow teams to specialize in different areas, such as user interface (UI) design, business logic implementation, and infrastructure code development.
-   Use an architecture that promotes reusability across independent teams.
-   Increase the quality of applications by abstracting common services that are available to all the teams.
-   Incrementally integrate new capabilities.

## System Requirements

This guidance was designed to run on the Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008 operating systems. This version has been smoke tested on Windows XP Professional and Windows Server 2003, but it has not been exhaustively tested. WPF applications built using this guidance require the .NET Framework 4.0, and Silverlight applications require Silverlight 5.

Before you can use the Prism Library, the following must be installed:

-   Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional, Premium, or Ultimate edition
-   Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 (installed with Visual Studio 2010)
-   [Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=177428) (required for Silverlight development; includes the developer Silverlight runtime)
-   [Microsoft Silverlight 5 Tools for Visual Studio 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=229318) (required for Silverlight development; includes the developer Silverlight runtime)
-   Optional tools:
    -   [Expression Blend 4](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/blend_overview.aspx)
    -   [Windows Phone Developer Tools SDK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=185968) (for development with the Windows Phone 7)

>**Note:** If you want to download the Prism 4.0 – November 2010 release to use with .NET Framework 4.0, Visual Studio 2010, Silverlight 4.0, and Windows Phone 7, go [here for the Prism 4.0 Download](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=4922). The documentation did not change between Prism 4.0 – November 2010 and Prism 4.1 – February 2012.

>**Note:** Although the Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2010 are not required, it is recommended that all WPF and Silverlight developers download and use the latest version of the Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2010. The WPF and Silverlight Designer for Visual Studio is updated together with the Silverlight developer runtime and SDK. These updates come in the form of new features and bug fixes.

If you are authoring WPF and Silverlight projects that share code, you may want to read [Sharing Code Between WPF and Silverlight,](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff921109(pandp.40).aspx) and install the [Project Linker 2.2](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/5e730577-d11c-4f2e-8e2b-cbb87f76c044) tool.
