<span id="sec1"></span>What's New in This Release
=================================================

Prism 4.1 is primarily focused on updating Prism for Silverlight 5 and addressing issues identified by the community on CodePlex.

Changes based on Silverlight 5 features are:

-   The **UpdateTextBindingOnPropertyChanged** Expression Blend behavior (Silverlight only) has been marked obsolete as Silverlight 5 now offers **UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged**.
-   **DataTemplateSelector** (Silverlight only) has been marked obsolete as Silverlight 5 now offers implicit data templates.
-   **ButtonBaseClickCommand** has been marked obsolete.

CodePlex Issues:

-   [CodePlex Issue 5495](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/5495) - Added **InvokeCommandAction.**
-   [CodePlex Issue 4052](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/4052) - Changed type constraint from **Control** to **UIElement** in the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) **CommandBehaviorBase** and **InvokeCommandAction** classes.
-   [CodePlex Issue 8061](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/8061): Added **SyncActiveStateAttribute** to sync activate state with scoped regions.
-   [CodePlex Issue 7234](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/7234): **SubscriptionToken** is now disposable.
-   [CodePlex Issue 3896](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/3896): Added **ClearChildViewsRegionBehavior** and **ClearChildViews** attached property to optionally clear **RegionManager** on regions within a view.

Other Changes:

-   Library and projects have been updated to reference the latest Unity and Enterprise Library versions.
-   A new NuGet package (4.1.0.0) is available that includes the binaries for .NET Framework 4.0, Silverlight 4 and 5, and Windows Phone 7.1. Note that the Prism binaries for Silverlight 4 are the Prism 4.0.0.0 binaries.

**Note**: The documentation was not revised as part of this release, so it still refers to the 4.0 version, which remains accurate except for the changes listed above. Documentation on the new items above can be found later in this document.

<span id="sec3"></span>Installing Prism
=======================================

This section describes how to install Prism. It involves the following three steps:

1.  Install system requirements.
2.  Extract the Prism source code, binaries, and documentation.
3.  Register the Prism binaries.

<span id="_Toc276376481"></span>
<span id="sec4"></span>Step 1: Install System Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------

Prism was designed to run on the Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008 operating system. This version has been smoke tested on Windows XP Professional and Windows Server 2003, but it has not been exhaustively tested. WPF applications built using this guidance require the .NET Framework 4.0, and Silverlight applications require Silverlight 5.

Before you can use the Prism Library, the following must be installed:

-   Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 (installed with Visual Studio 2010)
-   Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional, Premium, or Ultimate editions

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><img src="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Gg405483.note(en-us,PandP.40).gif" class="note" />Note:</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition can be used to develop Prism applications using the Prism Library.<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If you are developing Silverlight applications, the following must be installed:

-   [Microsoft Silverlight 4 Tools for Visual Studio 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=177428) (required for Silverlight development; includes the developer Silverlight runtime)

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><img src="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Gg405483.note(en-us,PandP.40).gif" class="note" />Note:</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Although the Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2010 are not required, it is recommended for all WPF and Silverlight developers to download and use the latest version of the Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2010.<br />
The WPF and Silverlight Designer for Visual Studio is updated together with the Silverlight developer runtime and software development kit (SDK), which are included in the download. These updates come in the form of new features and bug fixes.<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Optionally, you should consider also installing the following:

-   [Microsoft Expression Blend 4](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/blend_overview.aspx). A professional design tool for creating compelling user experiences and applications for WPF and Silverlight.
-   [Windows Phone Developer Tools SDK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=185968). For Windows Phone 7.1 development.

<span id="sec5"></span>Step 2: Extract the Prism Source Code, Binaries, and Documentation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="_1_5_Compiling_the"></span><span id="_Toc276376482"></span>
To install the Prism assets, right-click the Prismv41.exe file, and then click **Run as administrator**. This will extract the source code, binaries, and documentation into the folder of your choice.

<span id="sec6"></span>Step 3: Register the Prism Library Binaries with Visual Studio
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Registering the Prism Library with Visual Studio is not required, but for many developers, doing this simplifies referencing the Prism Library assets in their own projects. If you elect to register the binaries, they will be listed in the Visual Studio **Add References** dialog box when adding a reference. If you elect to not register the binaries, you will need to manually set a file reference to the Prism Library binaries in your projects. The Prism Library signed assemblies will be placed in the following folders:

-   {prism}\\Bin\\Desktop
-   {prism}\\Bin\\Silverlight
-   {prism}\\Bin\\Phone

To register the Prism Library binaries, launch the RegisterPrismBinaries.bat batch file located in the folder where you extracted Prism. This batch file creates a temporary .reg file with the information required to register the Desktop, Silverlight, and Phone binaries and uses it to update the registry. Because updating the registry is a privileged operation, a User Account Control (UAC) prompt will appear if you do not have elevated privileges. For additional information about UAC, see [What is User Account Control](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-is-user-account-control).

| <img src="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Gg405483.note(en-us,PandP.40).gif" class="note" />Note:                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| At most, one copy of the binaries can be registered using the script; if multiple copies of the Prism Library are registered, only the binaries for the last registered copy will be available in Visual Studio. |

<span id="sec9"></span>Documentation Addendums for Prism 4.1
============================================================

<span id="sec10"></span>Using InvokeCommandAction
-------------------------------------------------

While Expression Blend offers the **EventTrigger** and **InvokeCommandAction**, this action does not update the control's enabled state if **ICommand** changes it. Prism's **InvokeCommandAction** will monitor the underlying ICommand’s **CanExecuteChanged** event and update the control’s enabled state appropriately. You can use it in place of Expression Blend's **InvokeCommandAction**:

    <TextBox>
      <i:Interaction.Triggers>
        <i:EventTrigger EventName="KeyUp">
            <prism:InvokeCommandAction Command="{Binding MyCommand}" />
        </i:EventTrigger>
      </i:Interaction.Triggers>
    </TextBox>  

<span id="sec11"></span>Applying ClearChildViewsRegionBehavior
--------------------------------------------------------------

In some scenarios where a view contains nested regions, the nested regions may need to be removed from the region manager when the parent view is removed from a region. To support this, an optional behavior was added that will clear the **RegionManager's** attached properties on those regions to force their removal from the region manager.

While the behavior is registered and available for all regions, it is optionally enabled for a view containing nested regions by using the **ClearChildViews** attached property:

    <UserControl x:Class="SomeModule.Views.RightView"
        ...
        xmlns:Regions="http://www.codeplex.com/prism"
        RegionBehaviors:ClearChildViewsRegionBehavior.ClearChildViews="True">
        ...

<span id="sec12"></span>Syncing Active to Scoped Regions
--------------------------------------------------------

To support scenarios where a parent view contains scoped regions, the regions and views within that scope may need to be notified when the parent view becomes active. To handle this, the **SyncActiveStateAttribute** can be applied to a View or ViewModel to ensure notification of the views (or view models) within the scoped regions.

    [SyncActiveState]
    public class MyViewModel : NotificationObject, IActiveAware
    {
           (...)
    }

<span id="sec26"></span>Stock Trader RI
---------------------------------------

The Stock Trader RI application is a reference implementation that illustrates the baseline architecture. Within the application, you will see solutions for common, and recurrent, challenges that developers face when creating composite WPF applications.

The Stock Trader RI illustrates a fictitious, but realistic financial investments scenario. Contoso Financial Investments (CFI) is a fictional financial organization that is modeled after real financial organizations. CFI is building a new composite application to be used by their stock traders.

**To run the Stock Trader RI:**

1.  You must have completed the steps in [Installing Prism](#installingprism).
2.  In Windows Explorer, double-click one of the following batch file to open the solution in Visual Studio: **Desktop & Silverlight - Open RI - StockTrader Reference Implementation.bat** or
3.  **Desktop only - Open RI - StockTrader Reference Implementaion.bat** (if you do not have Silverlight installed)
4.  To run the WPF version of the Stock Trader RI, set the StockTraderRI project (located in the Desktop solution folder) as the startup project.
5.  To run the Silverlight version of the Stock Trader RI, set the StockTraderRI project (located in the Silverlight solution folder) as the startup project.
6.  Press F5.

For more information about the Stock Trader RI, see "Stock Trader Reference Implementation" in the Prism4.pdf.

<span id="sec28"></span>UpdatePrismBinaries.bat
-----------------------------------------------

The purpose of the UpdatePrismBinaries.bat batch file is to help you automate rebuilding the Prism Libraries and copying them to the {prism}\\Bin folder. If you are using the signed binaries that were included in the download, you will not need to use this batch file. However, if you are modifying the Prism source and want to rebuild and copy your modified assemblies to the {prism}\\Bin folder, you can use this batch file to build and copy your assemblies.

<span id="sec29"></span>Known Issues
------------------------------------

-   When running the Silverlight applications using the beta version of Internet Explorer 9, it has been found that Internet Explorer 9 will sometimes display an error message when an application first starts. If this occurs, click the Internet Explorer 9 **Refresh** button, and then the page will load correctly.
-   After running the RegisterAssemblies.bat batch file, you may need to restart Visual Studio so that the Prism Library assembly references show up.
-   In solutions that have both Silverlight and WPF projects, the Visual Studio Designer will display an error if the correct startup project is not selected. When viewing Silverlight code, set the Silverlight project as the startup project. When viewing WPF code, set the WPF project as the startup project.
-   Running code analysis on the Prism Silverlight projects results in CA0055 warnings as FxCop cannot resolve references to older libraries. See [connect issue 713608](http://connect.microsoft.com/visualstudio/feedback/details/713608/ca0055-silverlight5-business-application-project). The Prism Library references versions of the Common Service Locator and Unity that still reference Silverlight 4.

<span id="sec30"></span>Adding Prism Library Source Projects to Solutions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of shipping the Prism Library as signed binaries, the Prism Library projects were removed from the solutions of all QuickStarts and reference implementation projects. This was to make sure that the binaries were not accidentally overwritten when a solution was compiled. If you are a developer accustomed to stepping through the Prism Library code as you build your application, there are a couple of options:

-   **Add the Prism Library Projects back in**. To do this, right-click the solution, point to **Add**, and then click **Existing project**. Select the Prism Library projects. Then, to prevent inadvertently building these, click **Configuration Manager** on the **Build** menu, and then clear the **Build** check box for all Prism Library projects in both the debug and release configurations.
-   **Set a breakpoint and step in**. Set a break point in your application's bootstrapper, and then step in to a method within the base class (F11 is the typical C\# keyboard shortcut for this). You may be asked to locate the Prism Library source code, but often, the full program database (PDB) file is available and the file will simply open. You may set breakpoints in any Prism Library project by opening the file and setting the breakpoint.

<span id="sec31"></span>Prism Library and Code Access Security
==============================================================

The Prism Library uses all the default .NET Framework settings with respect to signing assemblies and code access security. It is a recommended practice to strong name all your assemblies, including the Prism Library assemblies, shell assembly, and any modules you might want to create. This is not a requirement. It is possible to load assemblies that have not been signed into a (signed or unsigned) Prism Library application. You can change this behavior by applying a .NET Framework security policy that does not allow the use of unsigned assemblies or one that changes the trust level of an assembly. Please note that the .NET Framework does not allow you to load partially trusted assemblies, unless you add the **AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers** attribute to the Prism Library assemblies.

For more information, see [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/930b76w0.aspx) in the .NET Framework Developer's Guide on MSDN.
