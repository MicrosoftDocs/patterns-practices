<span id="sec3"></span>Download and Setup the Prism Source Code
===============================================================

This section describes how to install Prism. It involves the following three steps:

1.  Install system requirements.
2.  Download and extract the Prism source code and documentation.
3.  Compile and run the QuickStarts, Reference Implementation, or Prism Library source code.

<span id="InstallSysReq"></span><span id="_Toc276376481"></span>
<span id="sec4"></span>Step 1: Install System Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------

Prism was designed to run on the Microsoft Windows 8 desktop, Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008 operating system. WPF applications built using this guidance require the .NET Framework 4.5.

Before you can use the Prism Library, the following must be installed:

-   Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 (installed with Visual Studio 2012) or Microsoft .NET Framework 4.51.
-   Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 Professional, Premium, or Ultimate editions.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Visual Studio 2013 Express Edition can be used to develop Prism applications using the Prism Library.<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Optionally, you should consider also installing the following:

-   [Microsoft Blend for Visual Studio 2013](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/blend_overview.aspx). A professional design tool for creating compelling user experiences and applications for WPF.

<span id="sec5"></span>Step 2: Download and Extract the Prism Source Code and Documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can download the source code for the Prism library, the reference implementation and the QuickStarts from the following link:

-   [**Prism 5.0**](http://aka.ms/prism-wpf-code)

<span id="_1_5_Compiling_the"></span><span id="_Toc276376482"></span>
To install the Prism assets, right-click the exe file or zip file, and then click **Run as administrator**. This will extract the source code into the folder of your choice.

<span id="sec6"></span>Step 3: Compile and Run QuickStarts, Reference Implementation, or Prism Library Source Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to build and run the reference implementation and the QuickStarts, select the appropriate shortcut file and press F5 to build and run.

The reference implementation and QuickStarts use NuGet references to the Prism library assemblies so you can compile and run each solution directly.

<span id="_Toc276376501"></span>
<span id="sec7"></span>Adding Prism Library Source Projects to Solutions
========================================================================

As part of shipping the Prism Library as NuGet packages, the Prism Library projects were removed from the solutions of all QuickStarts and reference implementation projects. If you are a developer accustomed to stepping through the Prism Library code as you build your application, there are a couple of options:

-   **Add the Prism Library Projects back in**. To do this, right-click the solution, point to **Add**, and then click **Existing project**. Select the Prism Library projects. Then, to prevent inadvertently building these, click **Configuration Manager** on the **Build** menu, and then clear the **Build** check box for all Prism Library projects in both the debug and release configurations.
-   **Set a breakpoint and step in**. Set a break point in your application's bootstrapper, and then step in to a method within the base class (F11 is the typical C\# keyboard shortcut for this). You may be asked to locate the Prism Library source code, but often, the full program database (PDB) file is available and the file will simply open. You may set breakpoints in any Prism Library project by opening the file and setting the breakpoint.
