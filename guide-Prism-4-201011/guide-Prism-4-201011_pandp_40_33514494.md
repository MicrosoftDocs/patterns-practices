This topic describes how to upgrade a solution from version 4.1 to version 5.0 of the Prism Library and the major changes that you should be aware of if you are considering upgrading to the 5.0 version.

<span id="_Update_Namespace_and"></span>
<span id="sec1"></span>ViewModel Namespace and API Changes
----------------------------------------------------------

The classes in the **Microsoft.Practices.Prism.ViewModel** namespace were made obsolete but still exist in Prism 5.0. You should use the classes from the **Microsoft.Practices.Prism**.**Mvvm** portable class library with **Microsoft.Practices.Prism**.**Mvvm** namespace. The **BindableBase** class replaces the **NotificationObject** class. If you need to implement **INotifyPropertyChanged** event, you should now use **BindableBase**, and use the **SetProperty** method in the property setter, which verifies if the value actually changed and if so, sets the backing field and raises the **PropertyChanged** event.

The 4.1 code was as follows:

    this.RaisePropertyChanged(() => this.WatchListItems);

    . . .

    if (value != this.timeInForce)
    {
       this.timeInForce = value;
       this.RaisePropertyChanged(() => this.TimeInForce);
    }

The 5.0 code is as follows:

    OnPropertyChanged(() => this.WatchListItems);

    . . . 

    SetProperty(ref this.timeInForce, value);

The Prism NuGet package will manage the changes to the new Prism assemblies.

If you decide to manually update your references, the **Microsoft.Practices.Prism.ViewModel** namespace now requires you to add the following references:

-   Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Mvvm
-   Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Mvvm.Desktop
-   Microsoft.Practices.Prism.ShareInterfaces

<span id="_EventAggregator_API_Changes"></span>
Alternatively you can add a NuGet reference to the Prism.Mvvm package if you only want the Prism.Mvvm APIs.

<span id="sec2"></span>EventAggregator Namespace and API Changes
----------------------------------------------------------------

The classes in the Events namespace were made obsolete but still exist in Prism 5.0. You should use the classes from the **Prism**.**PubSubEvents** portable class library with the **Prism**.**PubSubEvents** namespace. The **PubSubEvent** class replaces the **CompositePresentationEvent** class.

The Prism NuGet package will manage the changes to the new Prism assemblies.

If you decide to manually update your references, you will now need to add a reference to the following:

-   **Microsoft.Practices.Prism.PubSubEvents**

<span id="_Regions_Namespace_API"></span>
Alternatively you can insert a NuGet reference to the Prism.PubSubEvents NuGet package if you only want the Prism.PubSubEvents APIs.

<span id="sec3"></span>Regions Namespace API Changes
----------------------------------------------------

The **UriQuery** class was replaced with the **NavigationParameters** class and moved to the **Regions** namespace. Previous functionality remains the same, and support for object parameters was added. The **RequestNavigate** method defined in the interface **INavigateAsync** was updated to allow the passing of **NavigationParameters**.

<span id="_Commands_Assembly_and"></span>
<span id="sec4"></span>Commands Assembly Changes
------------------------------------------------

The following classes from the **Commands** namespace were moved from the Prism library to the Prism.Mvvm portable class library:

-   **CompositeCommand**
-   **DelegateCommand**
-   **DelegateCommandBase**
-   **WeakEventHandlerManager**

For these classes you will only need to change your references to the Prism.Mvvm assembly.

The **CommandBehaviorBase** class was moved to the **Prism**.**Interactivity** namespace from the **Commands** namespace. The **ExecuteCommand** method now takes an object as a parameter.

The **ButtonBaseClickCommandBehavior** and **Click** classes were removed as they were obsolete last release.

<span id="_Prism_NuGet_Packages"></span>
<span id="sec5"></span>Prism NuGet Packages
-------------------------------------------

The following signed Prism assemblies can now be referenced from NuGet:

-   [Prism 5.0](http://aka.ms/prism-wpf-prism50nuget)
-   [Prism.Composition 5.0](http://aka.ms/prism-wpf-prism50compositionnuget)
-   [Prism.Interactivity 5.0](http://aka.ms/prism-wpf-prism50interactivitynuget)
-   [Prism.PubSubEvents 1.0](http://aka.ms/prism-wpf-prism50pubsubeventsnuget)
-   [Prism.Mvvm 1.0](http://aka.ms/prism-wpf-prism50mvvmnuget)
-   [Prism.UnityExtensions 5.01](http://aka.ms/prism-wpf-prism50unityextensionsnuget)
-   [Prism.MefExtensions 5.0](http://aka.ms/prism-wpf-prism50mefextensionsnuget)

The [Prism NuGet package](http://aka.ms/prism-wpf-prism50nuget) will download the Prism.Composition, Prism.PubSubEvents, Prism.Mvvm, and Prism.Interactivity NuGet packages.
